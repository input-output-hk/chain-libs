//! # Block
//!
//! The Block is the atomic element that compose a chain. Or in other
//! words the chain is composed of a succession of `Block`.
//!
//! the `Block` trait implements the necessary feature we expect of
//! a `Block` in the chain. Having a function that requires the object
//! to implement the Block traits means that we are expecting to have
//! only access to:
//!
//! * the block and its parent's identifier (the block hash);
//! * the block number, its position in the blockchain relative
//!   to the beginning of the chain. We often call this number
//!   the block Date.
//!
//! # Ledger
//!
//! this trait is to make sure we are following the Transactions of the chain
//! appropriately.
//!
//! # LeaderSelection
//!
//! This trait is following the protocol of the blockchain is followed
//! properly and determined a given instance of the LeaderSelection object
//! is selected to write a block in the chain.
